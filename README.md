# data_science_ii_speed-run

This is a small Python project created for our **Data Science II** course.  
Its purpose is to fetch data from the [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com) API so we can visualize and analyze speedrun statistics in our university project.

The script retrieves information about games, categories, leaderboards, and players,  
and saves it in a format that’s easy to use for further analysis (for example, in Jupyter notebooks or with pandas).

That’s all, just a simple helper tool to collect and prepare speedrun data for our visualizations.
